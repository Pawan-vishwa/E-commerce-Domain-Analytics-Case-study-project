# E-commerce-Domain-Analytics-Case-study-project

1. Comprehensive E-Commerce Domain Analytics Case study Platform Analysis.

 This project involves comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce platform using orders_table, products_table, customers_table, sellers_table, payments_table, and customers_review_table data. The objective is to      uncover key business insights including revenue trends,    category performance, seller activity, and customer experience.

3. Key Business Questions

   What is the cumulative revenue generated by the platform, and what trends can be observed in its evolution over time?

   Which product categories are the most favored on the platform, and how do their sales figures compare with each other?

   What is the mean order value (AOV) on the platform, and how does it differ across various product categories or payment methods?

   How many active sellers operate on the platform, and how does this count fluctuate over time?

   What is the breakdown of seller ratings on the platform, and how does this influence sales performance?

4. Dataset

    The analysis is based on the following dataset files:

    Orders_table.csv

    Order_Items_table.csv

    Products_table.csv

    Customers_review_table.csv

    Sellers_table.csv

    Payments_table.csv

    Customer_table

6.  Tools Required

    SQL Server Management Studio - Main data cleaning or the sql querry structure are made on the server studio . 

    Power BI Desktop -  Main Data Visualization platform is used for report creation.

    Power Querry - Data transformation  and cleaning layer for reshaping for reshaping and preparing the data.

    DAX (Data Analysis Expression)  - Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

    Data Modeling - Releationship established among tables (Customer_table,  Payments_table.csv, Sellers_table.csv, Products_table.csv, Order_Items_table.csv, Orders_table.csv) to enable cross-filtering and           aggregation

    File Format - .pbix for development and .png for dassboard previews.

7. Cumulative Revenue Trend Over Time

   SQL Logic :

   Select

	    FORMAT(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'yyyy-MM') AS [Month],
	    SUM(p.payment_value) AS TotalRevenue
  from Orders_table o
  Join Payments_table p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
  group by FORMAT(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'yyyy-MM')
  order by [Month];



  Select 
	  FORMAT(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'yyyy-dd') AS [Day],
	  SUM(p.payment_installments) AS TotalRevenue 
  from Orders_table o
  Join Payments_table p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
  group by FORMAT(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'yyyy-dd')
  order by [Day];


    Select 
	    FORMAT(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'yyyy-WW') AS [Week],
	    SUM(p.payment_installments) AS TotalRevenue 
    from Orders_table o
    Join Payments_table p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
    group by FORMAT(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'yyyy-WW')
    order by [Week];
